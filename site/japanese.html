    <p class="h4 pt-3 pb-1">All Katakana quiz</p>
    <p class="lead pt-2">Date of entry - 2021/5/20 </p>
    <p class="fw-normal py-4 text-break text-wrap lh-lg mx-5">Well, you know the drill at this point. This is the ALL katakana quiz, which refers to all of the characters (excluding special characters).  Of course, this was to test our abilities for katakana. Now, for this one, there isn't much. I basically learned the rest of the characters left, so that was what it was trying to prove. I will admit that I didn't get much time to study for it since I had a backlog of assignments and projects, and the Tokyo OPA + Letter to Saijo V2 project to do. And just to add to that, I was also practicing the Quizlet as well. So in the end, I barely got any time to work on this. But I did manage to go through it after a couple of tries. I did pause during some parts, but that was me trying to think how to write the characters out. Overall, I wouldn't say it's perfect, but it's not bad for the level of work that I have done so far. There weren't any struggles except that part where I struggled at. This whole experience was a really fun one. I've always wanted to learn Japanese since I was in middle school, and it's like my dreams finally becoming true. I may be a beginner, but this is the path you have to take in order to be better.  This is the path in order to become better. I technically don't need to write this one, but I'm doing it since I want to keep a record of what I have been doing all this time. But this is going to be the last entry when it comes to the digital portfolio. Maybe forever, but maybe for a few months as well. who knows? But this has been an adventure. I hope you people best and see you soon...

    <p class="lead pt-2">Date of entry - 2021/5/16 </p>
    <p class="fw-normal py-4 text-break text-wrap lh-lg mx-5">This one is about the Letter to Saijo V2. Well, this is kinda the same thing with the first one but this time, instead of introducing ourselves and writing about our daily lives, we introduce them to areas in San Francisco that they might want to visit and our opinions on them. We were also going to introduce what we wanted to do in Tokyo and to ask some "touristy" questions about Saijo. Now this one, we had to draw a map of SF with the places labeled as well. That took around a total of 4-6 hours to complete, and the Japanese portion took 6 hours to complete. The rest took another 4 hours to complete. So I ended up spending well over 16+ hours working on this thing in total. The preparation of the map was done earlier but still counts as the overall work as well. It's the same steps as last time, but we knew the names of the people who are our "penpal" letters. They will be writing back a letter for us to read soon. Now I don't know how long it would take, but I hope we are able to receive them since that is something that I wanted to do. To read the letters they sent us back. This one assumes that you had already read the last one, so there is no need to keep on sharing digital portfolio links and domains again. This one took a long time to do. And I didn't struggle as much as before. Maybe it's because that I have been doing this for almost a year? Who knows... But what is important is that I started to get used to this structure and how it works. It's somewhat basic, but I did go in-depth with this one. I spent hours writing and thinking about how to put this together. Taking time out of my sleep just so I can add these small details. I worked to great lengths on this one, and really put my soul into this. This one might be the last one for this class, so I wanted to make this one a special one.  And indeed this one is. There were a couple of mistakes, but those could be easily correct. The hardest part is the map of SF. Since I did this digitally, my drawing pen was having some issues regarding the pointer, so the lines were not as smooth as I would want them to be. So for the smooth lines, I had to switch to using my mouse for it. But that was the only struggle that I had with this one. And it was more or less the same length as the first one. Now, this pandemic has kinda screwed us all. This pandemic has been hard on everyone, including me. 500,000 deaths in the US, and over 3 million countings worldwide. We were forced to do this digitally citing covid risks. And it hasn't been easy to learn about this. Every single class, I spent time and effort on working and learning this. This has been a language that I've wanted to learn for years. And now here's the chance. I have meant with some people from japan a while ago in a program, but this one is kinda like one-on-one with my penpal. And this pandemic made it a lot harder to learn. Without showing it in person, things have been a lot harder to get ahold of.  And this is mostly true for everyone at one point. And I know this has been hard on the teachers as well.  And I'll repeat this: even though I'm a beginner language learner, this is the start. This is the start of countless dreams and possibilities. This is it. And I thought to myself: since we are closing this semester soon, I better make use of this. And so I did. I practiced the quizlets as a part of my may challenge, and constantly spent time grinding away on this one. I forced myself to work late nights, and to the point where I was only getting 3-5 hours of sleep daily. I forced myself to work so hard on this. And the effort is working. I'm finally seeing progress.  This may be the start, but it is the foundation that everything else is going to be built on. Next time, I would have continued to work even harder, and even harder. The last entry for this semester is going to be the all katakana quiz. And that's going to be it. I'm still working on improving this site as much as I can, but that might be the last one for a while...

  <p class="h4 pt-3 pb-1">Tokyo OPA</p> 
  <p class="lead pt-2">Date of entry - 2021/5/4</p>
  <p class="fw-normal py-4 text-break text-wrap lh-lg mx-5">Well, this format kinda is different, due to the way how adobe spark wanted me to embed the HTML code into it. And there's nothing I can do about it. But anyway, this assignment. This is the Tokyo OPA assignment, in which we are supposed to provide some images about places in Tokyo that we want to visit one day, and say stuff like the name, what type of place is it, and all of the other stuff like opinions as well. Honestly, I would say I didn't do that bad. I mean, the last one had a little bit of mistakes, but most of them were very clean and easy to follow. I wouldn't say it's perfect, but it's near-perfect for me. The last one was something about a restaurant. I chose the Ramen Atelier Nakiryū (創作麺工房 鳴龍). But for the video, I put it as Nakiryū to make it a lot easier. From what I gathered, it's one of the Michelin star restaurants. That means it's pretty expensive, but you know it has to be very very good as well.  Honestly, there wasn't anything setting me back. Some of the pronunciations were a little bit hard, but with a  little bit of practice, I managed to get through. But most of them weren't even that hard. Compared with the Shibuya project (which took like 12+ hours in total), this one only took 1-2 hours. And not to mention that I never really did much practice except in class.  Compared with the first project, this is really a massive improvement. Though this is just the basics of Japanese, there is still much to come. Reflecting back to the Nihon I know video, that one was me just basically struggling to put even the most basic of sentences together. And this one was just me speaking very fluently about the stuff that I wanted to do in Tokyo.  As we are closing this semester in less than a month, it's been a lifetime dream of learning Japanese. I remembered before COVID-19 started, I was one of the early ones to get called in for the class schedules next year. And somehow I managed to get in.  This whole year has been basically turned upside-down because of COVID-19. But anyway, this will be something that I would go on and look at later. There is so much that I can do, like more practice, and having a real one-on-one conversation with something like my teacher in Japanese. But this is only the start of a very very long journey. Learning a new skill and getting good at it takes years of dedication, and support to do it. For example, I’ve been playing piano for 11 years at this point. And I still haven't given up yet. And this applies to learning a new skill. Yes, you may feel like you want to give up, but in the end, it's all going to be worth it. You will see the light at the end of the tunnel one day... </p>

      <p class="lead pt-2">Date of entry - 2021/4/7</p>
      <p class="fw-normal py-4 text-break text-wrap lh-lg mx-5">This one is quite special since this is a digital letter to the students in one of the high schools in Saijo. The idea was to write a letter (both in Japanese and in English), and to kinda explain things like some basic info, what we usually do in a day, and other stuff. We first do it on google drawings and convert it to a pdf file. From there, we just give it to the teacher, and by April 5th, the teacher will send them all to the other teachers in Saijo, and they will print it out. And they will give it to the students. As of writing this, it's already 2 days past the due date, so I hope they already have read the letter and checked on this digital portfolio. The QR code just goes to this digital portfolio. Now, this was a fun experience and project to work on, since I already have gotten to interact with some of the students from that high school in Saijo.  And I know that they are going to see this digital portfolio once they scanned it. Originally, I had gotten a custom domain **<a href="http://exingcn.com">http://exingcn.com</a>, and made a version on my other accounts to add in the DNS records the domain, but I switched it to this digital portfolio last minute. This one is mainly for teachers and students to see, the other one is meant for more for family members, and the public to see. This project wasn't that challenging to work on, but I had a hard time getting started on the Japanese part of it. Until I managed to get it done by 2 am PST. The Japanese portion was the most difficult to work on, and I will admit there is a couple of mistake in there, but it just shows you that I’m learning and I make mistakes a lot. And that part took the longest to work on. The rest was easy to work on since the English portion only took around an hour to finish. Now, you may be asking: why are there 2 pages? There's only supposed to be one. Well, we were allowed 2 pages, if our letters were very long, just like mine. I had planned it where you would need both letters side by side in order to fully understand it. I added some captions, and some other stuff just for fun, and mostly covered the info from the Japanese part. But I also added a lot more, so it looks like an essay now. This project was the most exciting and fun to work on since I knew that the students from Saijo would be reading this. If you are reading this, I hope you enjoyed looking at the letter and my digital portfolio. I spent a lot of time working on this project.

        Well, another month has passed. And that means another challenge, and in this case, it's the March Challenge. This one is a little bit different, and we had to choose between 3 sets. This one was mainly focused on learning about different fruits and vegetables. I choose set B, where we had to write and list the fruits that we wanted to learn about in katakana and write about whether we liked them or not. We had to write out which fruits our family members liked and disliked. And the rest was mainly practice. (on the left, you can see some of the stuff that I wrote and practiced with) Well, just like last time, I didn’t have much time to commit to practicing this, but now I do have a lot more time. The rest of the time I have will be going to learning Japanese and putting my best effort into it. There was a massive growth if you look at the graph on the left. Compared to last month's monthly challenge, this is a big improvement. There were a few fruits that had some kanji in them, and that made it challenging to try and memorize. But a lot of them were the easy ones, that only had katakana on them. And that made it a memorable one since now I can tell someone what types of fruits I like in Japanese. This could be useful to introduce myself and to have some fun with my family. As I do more of these challenges, I start to realize the purpose of them: to challenge and get outside of your comfort zone. And this could be applied to a lot of things. Like life itself. You won't learn unless you put yourself outside your comfort zone. I will always remember this motto: Seek Discomfort. This comes from Yes Theory, and their videos have truly made me push myself outside my comfort zone. If it weren't for that moto, I would have chosen something easier.  As I’m still learning this language, the most important thing that I learned is to step outside your comfort zone and to practice. Just like learning how to code or how to play an instrument, you won't learn unless you put yourself outside your comfort zone. That is something to truly ponder on...

              <p class="fw-normal py-4 text-break text-wrap lh-lg mx-5">
               As you can see here, this is an entry for the February challenge. For the goals, I had the first one, which is to review materials and practice for around 10-15 mins a day, and just more practice. The second one was to research some words that I could use to describe myself better. The third one was to memorize the katakana characters.  And the 4th one was just more practice with hiragana and katakana. Now, I will admit that I didn't get to memorize all of them, but that was due to time constraints regarding extracurricular activities. But I did make some progress though. I did take my time to actually go ahead and write these out. When I had the free time, what I did was grab a piece of paper, and write down the katakana characters each 9-10 times. The plan was to repeat it until the month ended. But because of personal time constraints, I ended up stopping halfway there. As you can see on the left of this, that's the "evidence", which is the actual thing that I used to practice with. And personally, I gave myself a 2 star for number 3. But not all effort was in vain. The teacher had provided us with resources to help us with this. And one of them was very simple books but in Japanese (with a mix of kanji w/furigana). I took the time to read some of them, and one of them was called "何が飲みますか?" (なにがのみますか?). Which the translation should be "What [type] of drink is this?". So I spent my time reading that and believe it or not, it was really easy for me to read and understand that. The second one was "いました!", which is basically a cat going to a Shinto shrine to find the same type of animal as the cat. That one wasn't that hard to read and understand, but it did give me a decent challenge to get the definitions for it. Other than that, that's pretty much it. Now, I could have done better, such as better planning and optimizing workflow, but there isn't much I can do now, since the February Challenges are supposed to be done. The plan for the March Challenges is pretty much the same: complete the rest of the katakana (if I can) and read even more of those books and articles.

                  <p class="fw-normal py-4 text-break text-wrap lh-lg mx-5">
                    Well, as you can see here, we have another seesaw video, but this time it is about the schedule of my day (obviously it isn’t that in-depth). Now for this video, we created a basic visual presentation by making a google slides presentation and finding images that would suit us for the visual presentation. Stuff like the buses, pictures of certain subjects, and afterschool activities and stuff like that. While working on this, I didn’t find anything interesting since I already knew a lot of the subjects that I’m taking, such as math (which is Algebra 2/pre-calc), science (which is chemistry), and history (which is world history). But I did make a point to mention the teacher’s last names. But I also didn’t find anything that was interesting to me or other people. Since I already knew a lot of the information that I was about to say, there wasn’t anything new for me to find. But something I did find interesting is how foreign words are put in katakana. For example, one of the words that I was using was robotics (since I am already a part of the robotics team here at wash). In katakana, the first part “robo” (ロボ) is actually kept from the English word “Robo” (meaning automated, automatic). And the way that katakana handles the “tics” in robotics is fairly interesting as well. In katakana, it’s “tikkusu” (ティックス), which I guess sounds similar to “tics” in English. So the final word is “robotikkusu” (ロボティックス). Personally, there weren’t many challenging moments since it was okay in my opinion, but I did have issues trying to say it without having the awkward silence breaks in between words. In my opinion, it was a lot better than I expected, and especially we are only given around 20 minutes to finish this one. I mean, it’s a little bit rushed, but it does the job. Given that I’m still a beginner in Japanese, this is still to be expected. The reason why I call these parts challenging is that it took some practice in order to get some right. And even on the final run, I’m pretty sure that I got some of the words incorrect and still got some structures wrong as well. But that was probably me just rushing to get it out because I had my alg 2/pc class in like 4 minutes once I posted it on seesaw. The most important thing that I learned as a language learner is not to let your ego go too high. This certainly happened with me a lot of times, and I’m still a beginner learner, so I shouldn’t expect to be perfect and have everything figured out. I shouldn’t show off my skills and call it “perfect”. In the end, no one is perfect. We all have flaws in some way. But we can work on improving the flaws in order to make it better and to hone our skills. Personally, if I were to do this next time, I would have allowed myself to practice the day beforehand, and that way I can have a better and smoother speech at the end. But I couldn’t due to time restriction and other classes, so I will give leniency this time only.

                      Well, as you can see here on the left, this was for the "My January Challenge", where we had to work towards 4 goals for this class. And here are them as listed: 1) Able to read & write short stories in Japanese  2) Able to introduce his/her/themselves with more relevant info and accurate structures  3) Able to utilize a variety of vocabulary for the person's needs  4) Able to comprehend short messages in Japanese (become more comfortable w/ unfamiliar words). We, as you can see, my "activity" didn't really make it in terms of being able to read and write short stories in Japanese, and introducing myself with more info and accurate structures. But I was able to score at least some points on goals 3 and 4. That's because, for this month's goals, I mainly focused on writing and reading Japanese, and doing some research when it comes to kanji characters. On the left, you see some kanji characters that I learned over this past month. The first set of kanji characters is 希望, which means hope. And the second one is 水, which is water and the third one is 分, meaning "part". And the ones you see mean school and hobby. Now, my main focus for this month was more on the characters and learning how to write and read them, but I never really focused on the other goals. Now, as you can see on the drawing for the goals, I didn't focus on goals 1 and 2, and for Feb, I am going to focus on all 4 goals instead. Personally, I would say that my growth when it comes to new vocab is growing and growing, and I'm starting to comprehend short messages in Japanese. It might take a while, but these are just the first "baby steps". As we move into the next month, the new plan is to develop an activity in which I'm supposed to make some short stories using vocab that I found, and with that vocab, I'm able to introduce myself with some more info.  And the way that I'm going to do that is to look up some characters that I like and try and somehow use them in that short story. And once I feel like that short story is ready, I would share it with my teammates during the demonstration day and share it out with some of my friends and relatives. Now, it's going to be tricky to figure out how to do it, but if we take it one step at a time, we can eventually reach the point where we can be successful and use it in the real world.
